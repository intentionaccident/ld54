harbour space, harbour itself space
swap crates around
push them back
hold crate (pick up with crane and basically have like a slot, 'hold slot' like in tetris)
ships for repair don't need crates
pushing lane forward
eat all ship for a few rounds
> Fix issue where last slot is pushed down, but instead of being consumed, it moves creating wrong stuff

Ships that take nothing but just block for a few turns

"tetris hold"


My gameplan
1. Playtest -> Separate into levels with different diff. and abilites
2. Animations
3. Level intro popup (tutorial kinda thingy)
4. Integrate hand drawn textures
...
27. Upgrade menu


idea:
- Change magnet: select crate, all items in lane moves closer (compresses) around crate
- "slow" ability, basically reverse of one tick flush


Add arrow underneath next crate request on ship
Add pier background
Add score

Add deck
Add level popup
Add ability icons
Add sound effects

Rebalance levels a lil bit (introduce abilites)

Weigh request crate on ship by position
upcoming pool count should be weighted items
we remove items from upcoming pool count based on whats on belt, starting with the highest weighted item
We can then scale down weighting
